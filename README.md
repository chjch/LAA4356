# GIS tutorials for LAA 4356

This set of tutorials are developed for
_LAA 4356: Environmental Planning & Design Studio_ that is offered by the
[School of Landscape Architecture and Planning](https://dcp.ufl.edu/slap/) at
the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/).
With this series of tutorials, we intend to get you up to speed with the
essential techniques you need to complete the tasks  the studio.

We chose to use _GitHub_ as the platform to distribute this series of GIS
tutorials because (a) it offers high accessibility, you can review them using
either your browser on a desktop computer or your mobile device as long as you
have internet; (b) it is web-based, light-weight, and great way to organize
materials including links, images, and documents; and (c) it is a great way to
tracking updates (version control) made to the content, and great to host the
material for the long-term.

## 1. Description

We encourage every student to use ArcGIS Pro as their platform of choice to do
all the analysis for the project.
However, you should know that knowledge and prior experience in other GIS
software, such as ArcMap, is applicable and crucial as well.
The skill of using GIS analysis to solve problems and strengthen your landscape
design is what we hope you to learn and develop.
That said, all the tutorials below were prepared using ArcGIS Pro.

1. [Software setup and datasets](tutorials/1-software_and_data.md).
2. [Get to know ArcGIS Pro](tutorials/2-learn_arcpro.md).
3. [Landscape Design with Raster Data](tutorials/3-raster_design.md).
4. [Introduction to Geoprocessing Tools for Raster Data](tutorials/4-raster_geoprocessing.md).
5. [Using ModelBuilder to automate geoprocessing operations](tutorials/5-modelbuilder.md).
6. [Create ArcGIS StoryMaps](tutorials/6-story_map.md)
